This is a experimental HSM daemon and migrate tool. It is meant to be
a platform for testing ideas in HSM migration.

To download the code, either fetch with your web browser, or use git
like this:

   git clone http://samba.org/~tridge/hacksm/.git

To use it first setup a shared filesystem with NFS to hold the HSM
"store", putting it in the HSM_STORE location from hacksm.h. The
default is /hacksm_store

Then start the HSM daemon like this:

   hacksmd /gpfs &

You can then migrate files using hacksm_migrate, and view their state
using hacksm_ls

You may also want to look at
 
  http://samba.org/~tridge/junkcode/tsm_torture.c

for a test program that stresses out HSM implementations
