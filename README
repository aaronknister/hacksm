This is a experimental HSM daemon and migrate tool. It is meant to be
a platform for testing ideas in HSM migration.

To use it first setup a shared filesystem with NFS to hold the HSM
"store", putting it in the HSM_STORE location from hacksm.h

Then start the HSM daemon like this:

   hacksmd /gpfs &

You can then migrate files using hacksm_migrate, and view their state
using hacksm_ls
